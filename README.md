     - Sort the array in both ascending and descending order.
     - Display the sorted arrays.

3. **Assignment 3: Matrix Multiplication**
   - **Problem Statement:** Write a C program to perform matrix multiplication.
     - Take two matrices as input from the user (ensure the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix).
     - Multiply the matrices and print the resulting matrix.

4. **Assignment 4: Find the Largest Number Using if-else**
   - **Problem Statement:** Write a C program that takes four numbers as input from the user and prints the largest number among them.
     - Use if-else statements for decision making.

5. **Assignment 5: Sum of Natural Numbers Using for Loop**
   - **Problem Statement:** Write a C program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers, where n is a positive integer entered by the user.
     - Use a for loop to calculate the sum.

6. **Assignment 6: Display Multiplication Table**
